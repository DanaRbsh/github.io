          <h4><em> <strong>Biography</strong></em></h4>
          <p><em>I was born and lived like all ordinary people. School - Lyceum - University. Postgraduate studies at an excellent university in the city of Kiev. Then a family, two children. And I ask myself is this really all that I can achieve in life?</em></p>
          <p><em> My kids teach me how to work under pressure in short time conditions with high creativity level (Yep, our kids are like this). And here you are, in the door with a sign of "Make your choice". Time to decide, who are you.</em></p>
          <p><em>My way of web development is still in the beginning. But I should say that the skills, wich I get thanks to my kids, help me to constantly improve myself, develop my skills and never give up.</em></p>
